  <b>Data:</b><br />
  Annual temperature anomaly relative to pre-industrial levels (1850-1900), until
  2023 (up to October only) the data is from World Meteorological Organization, which
  is the mean of five datasets: HadCRUT5, NOAA, GlobalTemp, GISTEMP, ERA5 1, and
  JRA55. The data of the projected temperature anomalies based on the five SSP scenarios
  after 2023 are from the IPCC Sixth Assessment report. Ideally the historical and
  projected data would be from the same sources, but IPCC historical data is not
  as updated as the WMO data. The original climate stripes idea was developed by
  Ed Hawkins, this is one of the many adaptations.

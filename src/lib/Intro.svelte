    Just over the last few years, wildfires, heatwaves, extreme weather events
    have become visibly more frequent, with ever increasing record-breaking
    temperatures. These are symptoms of change that has been happening in the
    background for some time now. How does our current world compared to that
    when we were born? How has our planet changed throughout the course of our
    lives, short on the scale of a planet but long given the pace of global
    warming? Finally let's think about how our collective decisions can shape a
    future for the youth and humans who are not yet born.
    <br /><br />
    Each of the stripes below represent the annual temperature change relative to
    pre-industrial levels, meaning the long-term average of 1850-1900. Until 2023
    we are seeing historical temperature anomalies calculated by the WMO, while after
    2023 the colors show projected temperatures based on the five Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways according to IPCC.

    In recent years, wildfires, heatwaves, and other extreme weather phenomena
    have become more frequent, accompanied by a rise in record-breaking
    temperatures. These events, symptoms of larger changes worldwide, beg the
    question: How has the planet evolved throughout our lifetimes? Or more
    specifically, how does our current world compare to the world when we were
    born? Human existence may be short in the grand scheme of things, but our
    impact has accelerated the pace of global warming. Looking ahead, it's
    important to consider how our decisions today shape the futureâ€”not only for
    ourselves but also for future generations.

    Below, each stripe represents the annual temperature change relative to pre-industrial
    levels, defined as the long-term average between 1850-1900. Historical temperature
    anomalies calculated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) are depicted
    until 2023, while projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change's (IPCC) five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways are represented from 2023
    onwards.
